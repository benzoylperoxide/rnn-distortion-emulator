# rnn-distortion-emulator
FA24 Machine Learning Final Project

Project Proposal
In my final project, I am going to leverage a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to train a black-box model on audio data to learn the nonlinear signal transformation applied by analog distortion effects for electric guitar. This data will be collected from real hardware. I will also be attempting to infer from this model in real time using a reasonably powerful DSP platform like the Daisy Seed to evaluate its efficacy as a live effects unit itself.
